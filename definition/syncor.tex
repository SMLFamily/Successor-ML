\subsection{Reserved Words}
The\index{6.1}
following are the {\sl reserved words} used in the Core.   They
may not (except~~{\tt =}~) be used as identifiers.
%In this document the alphabetic reserved words are
%always shown in typewriter font.

\subsection{Special constants}
\label{cr:speccon}
\REPL{A {\sl positive integer constant (in decimal notation)} is
a non-empty sequence of decimal digits
$\boxml{0},\twoldots,\boxml{9}$ and the underscore (\wildpat) that
neither starts nor ends with an underscore.

An\index{6.2} {\sl integer constant (in

An {\sl integer constant (in
hexadecimal notation)} is an optional negation symbol
followed by \boxml{0x} followed by a non-empty sequence of
hexadecimal digits $\boxml{0},\twoldots,\boxml{9}$
and $\boxml{a},\twoldots,\boxml{f}$\ADD{ and the underscore that neither starts nor ends

($\boxml{A},\twoldots,\boxml{F}$
may be used as alternatives for $\boxml{a},\twoldots,\boxml{f}$.)
\ADD{
An {\sl integer constant (in binary notation)} is an optional negation
symbol followed by \boxml{0b} followed by a non-empty sequence of binary digits $\boxml{0},\boxml{1}$
and the underscore that neither starts nor ends with an underscore.
}

A {\sl word constant (in decimal notation)} is \boxml{0w}  followed
by a non-empty sequence of decimal digits\ADD{ and the underscore that neither starts nor
ends with an underscore}.
A {\sl word constant

ends with an underscore}.
\ADD{A word constant (in binary notation) is \boxml{0wb} followed by a non-empty
sequence of binary digits and the underscore that neither starts nor ends with
an underscore.}

A {\sl real constant} is an integer constant in decimal notation,
possibly followed by a point ({\tt .}) and \REPL{a positive integer constant in decimal notation}{ one or
more decimal digits}, possibly followed by an exponent symbol ~({\tt E} or {\tt e})~ and an integer
constant in decimal notation; at least one of the optional parts must occur, hence no integer
constant is a real constant.
Examples:
\begin{center}
  {\tt 0.7}~~~{\tt 3.32E5}~~~\verb(3E~7(~~~\ADD{\tt 3.141\wildpat592\wildpat653}
\end{center}%
Non-examples:
\begin{center}
  {\tt 23}~~~{\tt .3}~~~{\tt 4.E5}~~~{\tt 1E2.0}~~~\ADD{\tt 1\wildpat.5}~~~\ADD{\tt 3.\wildpat{}678}
~~~\ADD{\tt 1.\wildpat{}E2}
\end{center}%

We assume an underlying alphabet of $N$ characters ($N \geq 256$), numbered
$0$ to $N-1$, which agrees with the ASCII character set on the characters
numbered 0 to 127. The interval $[0, N-1]$ is called the {\sl ordinal range} of
the alphabet.
A {\sl string constant} is a sequence, between quotes ({\tt "}), of zero or
more printable characters (i.e., numbered 33--126), spaces or escape
sequences.
Each escape sequence starts with the
escape character ~\verb+\+~, and stands for a character sequence. The
escape sequences are:
\bigskip

                of ~{\tt\char'134\char'136}$c$~ is 64 less than the
                number of $c$.\cr
\verb+\+$ddd$ & The single character with number $ddd$ (3 decimal digits
denoting an integer in the ordinal range of the alphabet).\cr

              where $f\cdot\cdot f$ stands for a sequence
             of one or more formatting characters.\cr
}
\medskip

The {\sl formatting characters}\index{6.3} are a subset of the non-printable
            characters including at least space, tab, newline, form feed\FIX{, vertical tab, and carriage return}.
The last form allows long strings to be written on more than one line, by
            writing ~\verb+\+~ at the end of one line and at the start of the
            next.\nopagebreak

\insertion{\thescon}{A {\sl character constant} is a sequence of the form
{\tt\#}$s$, where $s$ is a string constant denoting a string of size one character.

Libraries may provide multiple numeric types and multiple string types.
To each string type
corresponds an alphabet with ordinal range $[0, N-1]$
for some $N\geq 256$; each alphabet must agree with the ASCII character set on
the characters numbered 0 to 127. When multiple alphabets are supported,
all characters of a given string constant are interpreted over the same
alphabet. For each special constant, overloading
resolution is used for determining the type of the constant
(see Appendix~\ref{overload.sec}).

%   All the escape sequences in a given string constant are interpreted
%   over the same underlying alphabet (either 8-bit characters or 16-bit
%   characters), and for each string constant this alphabet is determined
%   by overloading resolution (see Appendix~\ref{overload.sec}).
%   It is a compile-time error
% if the
%constant contains an escape sequence of the form $\uconst$ where
%$xxxx$ denotes an integer outside the ordinal range of the alphabet so
%determined. For example, within a sequence of 8-bit characters, the
%two leftmost hexadecimal digits of $\uconst$ must be {\tt 0} (zero).
}

We denote by {\SCon} the class of {\sl special constants}, i.e., the integer,
real, \insertion{\thescon}{word, character} and string constants; we shall use {\scon}
to range over \SCon.\index{6.4}

\caption{Identifiers}
\label{identifiers}
\vspace*{-3mm}
\end{figure}
We use $\vid$, $\tyvar$ to range over
$\VId$, TyVar etc.  For each class
X marked ``long'' there is a class longX of {\sl long identifiers}; if
$x$ ranges over X then {\it longx} ranges over longX.  The syntax of
these long identifiers is given by the following:
\vspace*{-6pt}
\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{rcll} {\it longx} & $::=$ & $x$ & identifier\\
& &$\strid_1.\cdots.\strid_n.x$ & qualified identifier ($n\geq 1$)
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}
\vspace*{-6pt}
The qualified identifiers constitute a link between the Core and the
Modules. Throughout this document, the term ``identifier,'' occurring
without an adjective, refers to non-qualified identifiers only.
%version 2: For each class X marked
%``long'' there is also a class
%\[ {\rm LongX} = \StrId^\ast \times {\rm X} \]
%If $x$ ranges over X, then {\it longx}, or
%$\strid_1.\cdots.\strid_k.x$, $k\geq 0$, ranges over LongX.
%These long identifiers constitute the only link between the Core
%and the language constructs for Modules; by omitting them, and the $\OPEN$
%declaration,
%we obtain the Core as a complete programming language in
%its own right. (The corresponding adjustment to the Core static and
%dynamic semantics is simply to omit structure environments $\SE$.).

An identifier is either {\sl alphanumeric}: any sequence of
letters, digits, primes ({\tt '}) and underbars (\wildpat) starting
with a letter or prime, or {\sl symbolic}: any non-empty sequence of the
following {\sl symbols}\index{7.3}
\vspace*{-6pt}
\begin{center}
%\verb(!  %  &  $  +  -  /  :  <  =  >  ?  (@\verb(  \  ~  `  ^  |  *(
\verb(!  %  &  $  #  +  -  /  :  <  =  >  ?  @  \  ~ ( \tt{\textasciigrave} \verb(  ^  |  *(
\end{center}
\vspace*{-6pt}
In either case, however, reserved words are excluded.   This means that for
example ~\verb+#+~ and ~{\tt |}~ are not identifiers, but  ~\verb+##+~ and
~{\tt |=|}~ are identifiers.
The only exception to this rule is that the symbol ~{\tt =}~, which is
a reserved word, is also allowed as an identifier to stand for
the equality predicate.
The identifier ~{\tt =}~ may not be re-bound;
this precludes any syntactic ambiguity.

A type variable $\tyvar$\index{7.4}\label{etyvar-lab} may be any
alphanumeric identifier starting with a prime; the subclass EtyVar of
TyVar, the {\sl equality} type variables, consists of those \ADD{which}
start with two or more primes.
%poly
The classes {\VId},
{\TyCon} and  {\Lab} are represented by identifiers
not starting with a prime.
However,\index{7.5} {\tt *} is excluded from {\TyCon},
to avoid confusion with the derived form of tuple type (see
Figure~\ref{typ-gram}). The class Lab\index{8.2} is extended to
include the {\em numeric} labels ~{\tt 1}~~{\tt 2}~~{\tt 3}~ $\cdots$,
i.e. any numeral not starting with~{\tt 0}. \insertion{\theidstatus}{The
identifier class $\hbox{\StrId}$ is represented by alphanumeric
identifiers not starting with a prime.}

TyVar is therefore disjoint from the other four classes.
Otherwise, the syntax class of an occurrence of
identifier $\id$ in a Core phrase (ignoring derived forms,
Section~\ref{cor-der-form-sec}) is determined thus:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Immediately before ``.'' -- i.e. in a long identifier -- or in an
        $\OPEN$ declaration, $\id$ is a structure
        identifier.  The following rules assume that all occurrences of
        structure identifiers have been removed.
  \item At the start of a component in a record type, record pattern or record
        expression,  $\id$ is a record label.
  \item Elsewhere in types $\id$ is a type constructor.
%  \item Elsewhere $\id$ is an exception name if it occurs immediately after
%        $\RAISE$, at the start of a handler rule $\hanrule$, or within an
%        $\EXCEPTION$ declaration or specification.
  \item Elsewhere, $\id$ is a value identifier.
\end{enumerate}%

By means of the above rules a compiler can determine the class to which each
identifier occurrence belongs; for the remainder of this document we shall
therefore assume that the classes are all disjoint.

\subsection{Lexical analysis}
Each\index{8.4} item of lexical analysis is either a reserved word, a numeric label, a
special constant or a long identifier.
Comments and formatting characters
separate items (except within string constants; see Section~\ref{cr:speccon})
and are otherwise
ignored.   At each stage the longest next item is taken.

\subsection{Infixed operators}
\label{infop.sec}
An\index{8.5} identifier may be given {\sl infix status} by the
~$\INFIX$~ or ~$\INFIXR$~ directive, which may occur as a
declaration; this status only pertains to its use as a
$\vid$ within the scope (see below) of the
directive, and in these uses it is called an {\sl infixed operator}.
(Note that qualified identifiers never have infix status.)  If
$\vid$
has infix status, then ``$\exp_1\ \vid\ \exp_2$''
(resp.\ ``$\pat_1\ \vid\ \pat_2$'') may occur -- in parentheses if necessary -- wherever
the application ``$\vid$\verb+{+{\tt 1=}$\exp_1$\verb+,+{\tt
2=}$\exp_2$\verb+}+'' or its derived form
``$\vid$\verb+(+$\exp_1$\verb+,+$\exp_2$\verb+)+'' (resp
``$\vid$\verb+(+$\pat_1$\verb+,+$\pat_2$\verb+)+'') would otherwise
occur.  On the other hand, an occurrence of any long identifier (qualified
or not) prefixed by {\OP} is treated as non-infixed. The only required
use of {\OP} is in prefixing a non-infixed occurrence of an
identifier $\vid$ \REPL{that}{which} has infix status\FIX{ in an expression or pattern}; elsewhere {\OP}, where
permitted, has no effect.\index{9.1}
Infix status is cancelled by the ~$\NONFIX$~
directive.  We refer to the three directives collectively as {\sl fixity directives}.

The form of the fixity directives is as follows ($n\geq 1$):
\[ \newlonginfix \]
\[ \newlonginfixr \]
\[ \newlongnonfix \] where $\langle d\rangle$ is an optional decimal digit $d$ indicating
binding precedence. A higher value of $d$ indicates tighter binding;
the default is {\tt 0}. ~$\INFIX$~ and ~$\INFIXR$~ dictate left and right
associativity respectively. In an expression of the form  $\exp_1\, \vid_1\, \exp_2\, \vid_2\, \exp_3$, where
      $\vid_1$ and $\vid_2$ are infixed operators with the same precedence,
      either both must associate to the left or both must
associate to the right.
For example, suppose that {\tt <<} and {\tt >>} have equal precedence,
but associate to the left and right respectively; then
\medskip

\tabskip4cm
\halign to\hsize{\indent\hfil{\tt #}\tabskip1em&\hfil#\hfil\ &\ {\tt #}\hfil\cr
x << y << z&parses as&(x << y) << z\cr
x >> y >> z&parses as&x >> (y >> z)\cr
x << y >> z&is illegal\cr
x >> y << z&is illegal\cr}
\medskip
The precedence of infixed operators relative
to other expression and pattern constructions is given in
Appendix~\ref{core-gram-app}.

The {\sl scope}\index{9.2} of a fixity directive $\dir$ is the ensuing program text,
except that if $\dir$ occurs in a declaration $\dec$ in either of the phrases
\[ \LET\ \dec\ \IN\ \cdots\ \END \]
\[ \LOCAL\ \dec\ \IN\ \cdots\ \END \]
then the scope of $\dir$ does not extend beyond the phrase. Further scope
limitations are imposed for Modules\insertion{\theidstatus}{ (see
Section~\ref{infixopmod.sec})}.

These directives and ~$\OP$~ are omitted from the semantic rules, since they
affect only parsing.

\subsection{Derived Forms}
\label{cor-der-form-sec}
There\index{9.3} are many standard syntactic forms in ML whose meaning can be expressed
in terms of a smaller number of syntactic forms, called the {\sl bare} language.
These derived forms, and their equivalent forms in the bare language, are
given in
Appendix~\ref{derived-forms-app}.

%With one exception, these derived forms use no new lexical items.  The
%exception is that the symbol \verb+#+ prefixed to an identifier of the
%class Lab constitutes a
%lexical item;  \verb+#+{\it lab} denotes a selector function on records, cf. page~\pageref{der-exp}.


\subsection{Grammar}

The phrase classes for the Core are shown in Figure~\ref{cor-phr}.
We use the variable $\atexp$ to range over AtExp, etc.
The grammatical rules for the Core are shown in Figures~\ref{pat-syn} and~\ref{exp-syn}.

\caption{Core Phrase Classes}
\label{cor-phr}
\end{figure}

The following\index{10.1} conventions are adopted in presenting the grammatical rules,
and in their interpretation:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The brackets\index{10.2} ~$\langle\ \rangle$~ enclose empty and optional phrases.
  \item For any syntax class X (over which $x$ ranges)
we define the syntax class Xseq (over which {\it xseq} ranges) as follows:
    \begin{quote}
    \begin{tabular}{rcll}
       {\it xseq} & $::=$ & $x$ & (singleton sequence)\\
                  & 	  & $\langle \rangle$ & (empty sequence)\\
                  &       & \ml{(}$x_1$\ml{,}$\cdots$\ml{,}$x_n$\ml{)}
                                & (sequence,~$n\geq 1$) \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{quote}
(Note that the ``$\cdots$'' used here, meaning syntactic iteration, must not be
confused with ``$\mbox{\ml{...}}$'' which is a reserved word of the language.)
  \item Alternative forms for each phrase class are in order of decreasing
        precedence; this resolves ambiguity in parsing, as explained
        in Appendix~\ref{core-gram-app}.\index{10.3}
  \item L (resp. R)\index{10.4} means left (resp. right) association.

\item The syntax of types binds more tightly than that of expressions.

\item Each\index{10.6} iterated construct (e.g. $\match$, $\cdots$)
extends as far
right as possible; thus, parentheses may be needed around an expression which
terminates with a match, e.g. ``$\FN\ \match$'', if this occurs within a
larger
match.

\subsection{Syntactic Restrictions}\index{13.2}
\label{synres.sec}
\begin{itemize}
\item \CUT{No expression row,
      pattern row or type-expression row may bind the same $\lab$ twice.}\footnote{
        \ADD{This restriction is enforced by the static semantics of the core.}}
\item No binding $\valbind$, $\typbind$, $\datbind$ or $\exnbind$ may bind
      the same identifier twice; this applies also to value identifiers within
      a $\datbind$.
      \ADD{Identifiers appearing in both branches of a disjunctive pattern are bound
      only once.}
\item No $\tyvarseq$ may contain the same $\tyvar$ twice.
\item For each value binding \pat\ \ml{=} \exp\ \REPL{in a value declaration with $\REC$, }{within $\REC$,}
      $\exp$ must be of the form \fnexp. The derived form
      of function-value binding given in Appendix~\ref{derived-forms-app},
      page~\pageref{der-dec}, necessarily obeys this restriction.
\item No $\datbind$, $\valbind$ or $\exnbind$ may bind $\TRUE$, $\FALSE$, $\NIL$, \boxml{::} or $\REF$.
      No $\datbind$ or $\exnbind$ may bind {\tt it}.
\item No real constant may occur in a pattern.
\item In a value declaration  $\VAL\, \tyvarseq\, \valbind$, if $\valbind$
      contains another value declaration  $\VAL\, \tyvarseq'\, \valbind'$
      then $\tyvarseq$ and $\tyvarseq'$ must be disjoint.  In other
      words, no type variable may be scoped by two value
      declarations of which one occurs inside the other.  This
      restriction applies after $\tyvarseq$ and $\tyvarseq'$ have been
      extended to include implicitly scoped type variables, as
      explained in Section~\ref{scope-sec}.
\item[\textcolor{\fixcolor}{$\bullet$}]
      \FIX{Any $\tyvar$ occurring on the right-hand side of a $\typbind$ or $\datbind$ of the form
      ``$\tyvarseq$ $\tycon$ \ml{=} $\ldots$'' must occur in $\tyvarseq$.}
\item[\textcolor{\addcolor}{$\bullet$}]
      \ADD{The pattern $\pat_1$ in a nested match ``$\nestedpat$'' may not itself be a nested
      match, unless enclosed by parentheses.}
\item[\textcolor{\addcolor}{$\bullet$}]
      \ADD{The pattern $\pat$ in a $\valbind$ may not be a nested match, unless enclosed by parentheses.}
\end{itemize}
